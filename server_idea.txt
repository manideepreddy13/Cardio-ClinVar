four displays i.e, variants, gene, phenotypes and csv table

reactive - useful for dynamic change in the website

subset one stores the result from the query

VARIANT SUBPAGE

display number of variants

(assuming no filter option is chosen)
do this for every option

GENE SUBPAGE




FILTERING (LAST)

there are four more inputs to further filter the result i.e, clinical, consequence, type, review (could add more)
these come under a class called filter

query_two stores the filter input

if query_two empty or any filter_input empty
then return the result indices
else
return the specific result indices

if multiple filter_input
then return intersection of these indices

if intersection is null
then return null result
